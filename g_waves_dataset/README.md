The code inside "create_dataset.ipynb" assumes the presence of the h5 files inside the "/data/dataset/gwosc/..." directories and the presence of a "dataset", "test_dataset", "strain_pictures" and "non_strain_pictures" directory in the same path of the ipynb file to save the data that will be created in the notebook. I created such directories in this repository and left them empty on purpose.
